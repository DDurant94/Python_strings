1. Product Review Analysis
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to extract insights from product reviews by using string manipulation 
to categorize and summarize customer feedback for a SaaS product.

Task 1: Keyword Highlighter

Write a program that searches through a series of product reviews for keywords such as 
"good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", and "average". Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.
reviews = [
    "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
    "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
    "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
    "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
    "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."
]
Task 2: Sentiment Tally

Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review. Use a predefined 
list of positive and negative words to check against. The function should return the count of positive and negative words for each review.
positive_words = ["good", "excellent", "great", "awesome", "fantastic", "superb", "amazing"]
negative_words = ["bad", "poor", "terrible", "horrible", "awful", "disappointing", "subpar"]
Task 3: Review Summary

Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. 
Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

# i need to find the word first with a for loop in another for loop.
# i need to use .replace() so that i can change the word with another within the review.
